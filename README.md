# weight-prediction-model
This project implements a weight prediction model using supervised machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict a person's weight based on various input features such as height, age, and gender.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Handled missing data, feature scaling, and categorical variable encoding.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized data distribution and relationships between features using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Modeling: Trained multiple regression models including:
Linear Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Model Evaluation: Compared models using performance metrics like R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Cross-Validation.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized models using GridSearchCV for best performance.
Final Model Deployment: Selected the best model and exported it for further use.
Tech Stack:
Languages: Python
Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Tools: Jupyter Notebook
